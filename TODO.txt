LIST OF WORK TO DO (x = Complete. ? = May not be an issue. * Fix next)
------------------
Add versioning to database (e.g. Long version) and fix data problems such as duplicate connections
Honour URL args e.g.	http://localhost:59310/SocialGraphExplorer.html#1960788,99
Clean up 'details' person html.
	Check if html is in messy format and delete it if it is.
Add authentication.
Remove my LI cookies from  git so people cannot access my account
Add cookies to save state between uses (anchor:start)
Add Gears support
* Tune performance
	Stop discarding old requests
	Optimise number of simultaneous server calls in progress. Probably two.
Remove anchor from client cache. No need for it.
Replace arrays and null checks with lists and empty lists
Do stuff from 
	http://blog.hivedevelopment.co.uk/2009/08/google-web-toolkit-gwt-mvp-example.html (best practices)
	http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/ (Google social graph)
	http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/docs/testparse.html
		XFN and FOAF
		'me' and 'friend' links
Sort connection on 
	#connections
	location
	name
	Could do this by building indexes on server 
		One index per search type
		Array of int. Apply to connections then fetch from server
		Index generation will take time
			Maybe use Cron Jobs http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/cron.html
			Maybe use Task Queues http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#taskqueue
Handle &#x260  as in "? Adrian Cotterill ?"  
Remove "&amp;" etc from all strings
Add build from scratch script
Give visual feedback when on-screen data is being fetched (e.g. grey out people) Added 2009/08/31
Make UI usable
	Get feedback from users
	Keep list pointer at same location when going forward and back screens
	Grey when not responsive
	Distinguish main person from connections
	Move scroll controls out of table
Command line client
Cron jobs to update more records
	http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/cron.html
Generalise to m-clicks?
Test on all browsers and OSes
	Vista + Chrome, Opera, IE, Safari, Firefox ok
Inject server bugs and test client recovery	
	http://easymock.org/EasyMock2_5_1_Documentation.html
	JUnit
	Other test frameworks
Add Google Maps support to show geographical spread
Do Matthew UI of line to line connections on screen. Shows clusters of connections
Do David UI of a sphere.

BUGS
----
Find and fix all !@#$
Person is sometimes duplicated in his own connections list on UI
Remap URLs in HTML scraped from social networks (may be better to parse HTML)
Level 0 of client cache is empty
Moving between screens should maintain row position on screen
* RPC error (onFailureCallback()) when using back button
