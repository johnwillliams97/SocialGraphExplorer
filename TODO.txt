LIST OF WORK TO DO (x = Complete. ? = May not be an issue. * Fix next)
------------------
Honour URL args e.g.	http://localhost:59310/SocialGraphExplorer.html#1960788,99
Clean up 'details' person html.
	Check if html is in messy format and delete it if it is.
Add authentication.
Remove my LI cookies from  git so people cannot access my account
Add cookies to save state between uses (anchor:start)
Add Gears support
* Tune performance
	Stop discarding old requests
	Optimise number of simultaneous server calls in progress. Probably two.
	Add more instrumentation
		Client-side person fetch time  Done 2009/08/31
		Client-side total fetch time
Remove anchor from client cache. No need for it.
Replace arrays and null checks with lists and empty lists
Do stuff from 
	http://blog.hivedevelopment.co.uk/2009/08/google-web-toolkit-gwt-mvp-example.html (best practices)
	http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/ (Google social graph)
		XFN and FOAF
		'me' and 'friend' links
Sort connection on 
	#connections
	location
	name
	Could do this by building indexes on server 
		One index per search type
		Array of int. Apply to connections then fetch from server
		Index generation will take time
			Maybe use Cron Jobs http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/cron.html
			Maybe use Task Queues http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#taskqueue
