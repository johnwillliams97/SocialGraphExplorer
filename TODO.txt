BUGS
----
Find and fix all !@#$
whence=='nowhere' Fixed 2009/08/30
Does not get whole screen of data every time
	2009/08/28 Seem to be evicting invisible cache entries that are about to become visible
	2009/08/28 Partly fixed by clearing out all pending requests to ensure cache coherency 
				with clearPendingCacheEntries()
Does not always get details. whence=='CacheDB' Fixed 2009/08/30
Clicking on a partial record does not initiate extra fetches
Person is sometimes duplicated in his own connections list on UI
Remap URLs in HTML scraped from social networks (may be better to parse HTML)
Level 0 of client cache is empty
Moving between screens should maintain row position on screen
Grey non-anchor persons when moving between screens
